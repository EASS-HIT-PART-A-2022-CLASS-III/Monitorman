# Monitorman üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Monitorman is a web application that allows you to create and schedule custom HTTP requests and monitor their expected results. With Monitorman, you can easily set up automated tests to monitor the availability, performance, and correctness of your web services, APIs, and websites.

## Features üöÄ

- **Custom HTTP Requests**: Monitorman allows you to create custom HTTP requests with flexible options including URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), headers, query parameters, request body, and authentication.

- **Expected Results**: You can define expected results for each HTTP request, specifying the expected response status code, response headers, response body, or any combination of these. Monitorman will automatically validate the responses against the expected results.

- **Schedule Monitoring**: Monitorman enables you to schedule monitoring tasks to run at specified intervals, such as every minute, hourly, daily, or custom intervals. You can configure multiple schedules for each HTTP request, allowing you to monitor different endpoints with different frequencies.

- **Dashboard and Reports**: Monitorman provides a user-friendly dashboard that displays the status of your monitoring tasks in real-time. You can view historical monitoring results and generate detailed reports to analyze the performance and availability of your web services over time.
